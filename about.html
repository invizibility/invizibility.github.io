                I use a combination of aesthetic intuition and technical expertise to creatively solve problems at the intersection of audiovisual design and data science. I am interested in data visualization and adjacent methodologies as processes that can reveal/imagine various morphologies and narratives inside a set of data, ranging from scientifically objective maps and diagrams that render complexity knowable to abstract and aesthetically provocative forms which emphasize subjective experience. I designed a custom major at the University of Wisconsin-Madison called "information aesthetics", inspired by <a href="http://benfry.com/phd/dissertation-110323c.pdf">Ben Fry's thesis</a>, to study this interdisciplinary field, and this portfolio is a collection of my best work during my studies at UW. I am inspired by creatives both in the sciences and the arts who deal with themes of complexity and flow of information.
