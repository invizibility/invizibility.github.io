                            This project was done in collaboration with the Waisman Brain Imaging Laboratory at UW-Madison. I reached out to Waisman wanting to learn about visualization problems in neuroscience my sophomore year of college, and was forwarded to Dave Perlman, a Waisman researcher working with pain stimulus fMRI data. Dave&#39;s research involves, in his own words, &quot;studying the time course of the brain&#39;s response to pain as an indicator of ruminative or elabrorative mental processes that alter the overall aversive tone of the stimulus by extending the duration of affective response.&quot; Currently, being able to visualize the 4-dimensional data set of activation throughout the brain over a time interval is an extremely cumbersome task, and is a significant bottleneck for researchers trying to garner insights about affective chronometry in the brain. The present visualization packages provide extremely crude 3D rendering and almost no useful animation for activation maps.

                            I took on this project as a way to learn JavaScript and to become acquainted with biological imaging modalities, and to help Dave close the gap between his research results and an adequate presentation format. Before dealing with the visualization problem itself, I took on an introductory project of manually correcting algorithmically generated cortical surface files, so as to understand the data pipeline involved in neuroscience research. This step was immensely helpful for me, and understanding how different types of data that come off the MRI machine are computationally processed and analyzed really helped contextualize my design strategy. Next, I had to figure out the appropriate rendering context for the dataset. XTK.js is made by the creators of FreeSurfer and provides an API for parsing geometry from common medical imaging file formats, which made it an intuitive choice for my application.

                            Designing the brain viewing interface in JavaScript involved calibrating the registration and affine transformation of the anatomical volume, thresholding and layering the functional data over the anatomical data correctly, and assembling an intuitive GUI to bring it all together. Although I fell short of the ideal goal of having time series activation running with a slider in the browser, this project was effectively my first foray into computer graphics and helped me learn the fundamentals.
