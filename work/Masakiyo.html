                        This piece was one of my final projects in Derrick Buisch's color theory class at UW-Madison. We were required to create a collage incorporating at least 10 warm grays, 10 cool grays, and a range of blacks and whites; the main goal of this exercise was to learn how to use various hues as neutral values. We were additionally required to have elements painted onto the collage that color matched each of the grays utilized in the collage. The subject of my piece is inspired by the 1848 woodblock painting "Masakiyo blown up by a Land Mine at Kawanakajima" by Utagawa Kuniyoshi, which depicts the ritual suicide of a Japanese military general the instant before he is destroyed by enemy explosives. The collage section of my painting is the explosion itself, which in my rendition consists of cutouts from pornography and marijuana culture magazines, as well as several denominations of US currency.
