                        This visualization was created as one of my main projects in Meg Mitchell's Art 448 class "Web and Interactive Media". Meg's class was focused on exploring code as an art medium and the web browser and other networked technologies as an art delivery method. My goal in this class was to become comfortable with Processing and get acquainted with the workflow of being artistically creative with code.

                        In this project I looked to my external music hard drive as a source of data to creatively visualize. I have been collecting digital music since around 2005 and have approximately 1 terabyte of various digital music files, mostly mp3s. I lent my hard drive to a friend a couple years back so he could copy over some of my music, and he made an interesting comment about how the file structure of the drive tells an interesting story about how both my music tastes and music collecting habits have changed over time. The layers deepest under the root level are large folders filled with mp3s downloaded from various peer-2-peer filesharing sites such as LimeWire. These files are of various bitrates, have incomplete and nonsense metadata fields, and are not organized in any particular way. However the folders closer to the root, which are backups from when I started torrenting music, tell a different story. Unlike the LimeWire folders, these folders contain sets of many subfolders, each containing the files of some compilation/LP/EP/album. Not only are the styles of music present on this higher level different, but the metadata is comparatively pristine and the filenames are all consistent.

                        I wanted to make a visual analogy between the changing structural characteristics of my music library and the concentric rings on a tree trunk. First I wrote a Python script to pull folder, file, and mp3 metadata information for every digital sound file on the hard drive. I then implemented a Ring Chart class in processing to create a visual structure to organize the data. Every folder is shown as ring segment, and the rings are organized concentrically with respect to their heirarchy (the root level being the smallest ring in the center). Hovering over any ring segment will display the path to the folder and the number of songs in that folder, as well as highlight any existing relationship between the selected folder and a parent folder on a higher level. There are 3 color mappings that can be rotated with arrow keys. In blue mode, folder color is mapped to creation data of the folder; green mode maps to date last modified and orange maps to date last accessed. In each mapping, the darker colors represent the older values and the lighter colors represent the most recent. I hope to extend this visualization in the future to showcase the full extent of the mp3 metadata my script pulls, including change in genre preferences over time and other interesting patterns.
