                            For this project I explored the process of terrain generation in openFrameworks using shaders, and recontextualized the hyperspectral data I had worked with on my <a href = "http://invizibility.github.io/work/sonification.html">project with Andreas and Kevin at LOCI</a>. My prior engagement with this dataset was in the context of making its informational qualities more objectively apparent, whereas this time I was concerned with exploring its aesthetic qualities. My goal was to see how this dataset could be seen and navigated as some sort of cellular terrain. Additionally, I wanted to create this terrain in a way that reconstitutes the spectral dimensionality of the dataset and explores variations in spectra throughout the dataset in a way that creates an animated ‘living’ terrain. The idea of playing with scale and immersing the viewer in a cellular environment as seen through a constantly shifting spectral quantity was the aesthetic jumping-off point for this project.

                            I want to continue to develop this idea further and I need to further my grasp on GLSL/3d graphics in order to do so. I want to be able to generate vast tiling geometries that have continuous noise undulating throughout the tiles and have the spectral texture sampled in interesting variations--perhaps adjacent tiles have peaks of different height, or have valleys induced by negative displacement output from the shader. I need to make my shader more robust and complex in order to do all this programatically. Another idea I’ve had to vary the geometry more is to extract salient features from the raw hyperspectral dataset using computer vision. and assemble them in some sort of mesh packing / tessellation algorithm. This would create a terrain that has a basis in an image of an organic process, but can be algorithmically generated and tiled to fit a virtual space of arbitrary spatial dimensions.
