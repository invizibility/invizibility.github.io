                            I worked on this project during my Design Technologist/Creative Coding internship at Pitch Interactive during spring of my senior year at UW-Madison. I flew out to San Francisco at the beginning of the year to intern at Pitch for 3 months, wanting to get hands on experience in a data visualization studio environment. This project was one of several assignments Wes, the director of the studio, gave me over the course of my internship.

                            Capacitor is a dance troupe that is interested in using EEG data from their performers to drive a visual projection on the ceiling of their performance space as they perform. Wes gave me some EEG data from the dancers and asked me to design a Processing application that would explore the patterns created by fluctuations at each electrode mapped to a series of pulsating shapes. I designed an interface allows the user to assign a custom shape/color/rotation/pulse behavior to each electrode, and explore patterns created by various combinations of electrodes over the course of their respective time series. To allow smooth interaction with the time series data, I created a forked version of <a href = "https://github.com/tillnagel/timerangeslider">Till Nagel's "Animated Time Range Slider for Processing"</a> that supports nanosecond durations and non-range time increments. The slider was made publically available. This sketch was used for introductory data exploration; the final version of the project (completed after my internship was over) can be seen <a href="http://www.pitchinteractive.com/work/Capacitor.html">here</a>.
