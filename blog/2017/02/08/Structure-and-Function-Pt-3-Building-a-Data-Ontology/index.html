        <p>Once we did a bit of work establishing the blind spots of current data repositories hosting structure and function data, we worked to crystallize the principles that would inform our newly developed organizational paradigm for storing, browsing, and visualizing collections of structure and function data.<br>These principles were inspired both by the desire to go beyond currently available organzitional schema, as well as the desire to constrain our problem into a manageable enough scope to make the development of a prototype interface viable.</p>
<h2 id="Visual-Brainstorming"><a href="#Visual-Brainstorming" class="headerlink" title="Visual Brainstorming"></a>Visual Brainstorming</h2><p>As I did research about CHiP-seq, conformation capture, and the various range of cell types that might populate our prototypical library, I kept a journal where I kept note of potentially useful organizational heuristics and sketched out my mental model of data ontology. Gradually pulling a visual schema out of this organizational thinking exercise connects to some of the higher level goals of this project for me, namely using visualization to traverse high dimensional data-spaces. Here are some of my initial notes:</p>

<p>One crucial developmental point was coming to the conclusion that we needed ways to organize experiments both by what we know about them (e.g. attributes like phenotype, method, quality, date) as well as by direct computational comparison of experimental data which might capture similarity we <strong>don’t</strong> know about. It turns out many CHiP-seq experiments are done to capture binding affinities of proteins which have completely unknown function. If there is a protein with known function, and it has a similar binding pattern as a protein of unknown function, this a meaningful relationship we’d like to know about! Is there a way to make obvious such connections through a visual paradigm?</p>
