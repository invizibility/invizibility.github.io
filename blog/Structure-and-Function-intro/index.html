				<p>As mentioned in my introductory post, my culminatory work of this thesis project will be a portfolio of 3 design solutions to unique visualization challenges in genomics. One of these design projects is a collaboration with the <a href="http://guttmanlab.caltech.edu/">Guttman Laboratory for lncRNA Biology</a>, in which I will explore the creation of workflows for researchers interested in relationships between the physical structure of a genome inside a cell, and its functionality.</p>

<p>This project is an extension of some of the work I did this past summer as an intern in the JPL/Caltech Data Visualization Program. Over the summer, I worked with other interns and researchers at the Guttman Lab to understand the challenges involved in studying relationships between genomic structure and function. We learned that there are valuable insights to be uncovered through the analysis of DNA conformation data, but this analysis requires the navigation of very opaque and complicated datasets.</p>

<h2 id="basics-of-3d-genomics">Basics of 3D Genomics</h2>

<p>The 3 dimensional shape of DNA inside a cell consists of entanglements that occur across several orders of magnitude. The following graphic from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26226004">Ea et. al 2015</a> shows the way 2 meters of DNA sequence are packaged into 5 microns of spherically confined space in the center of the nucleus.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2016-09-28-Structure-and-Function-intro/conformation.png" alt="conformation" /></p>

<p>Understanding the unique circumstances under which a sequence will fold in different ways is critical to understanding how cells can exhibit a diverse array of behaviors driven by the same sequence, and how defects in genome structure can cause cancer and many other disease. The process of coming to such an understanding is a multistage process. Researchers must dive into conformation capture datasets, which are stored in the form of massive adjacency matrices, to observe patterns of topological association between certain segments of DNA sequence. Areas of interest must then be cross referenced against expermental data which describes functional behavior of regions of DNA sequence. Other researchers approach this problem in the other direction: a particular bit of sequence is interesting for its functional characterstics, so they want to see how that region of sequence conforms in 3d space under certain conditions. The unification of structural and functional data allows the researcher to formulate models for <strong>the general principles that determine 3D genome structure</strong> and <strong>relationships between 3d genome structure and specific cellular function</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-workflow">Creating a Workflow</h2>

<p>Bringing these two types of datasets together in a way that facilitates analysis and developing a <em>coherent workflow</em> for meaningful hypothesis generation is currently very difficult. The main hurdles to such a workflow are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The lack of tools to visualize and interact with 3D Genome structures. This was the subject of my summer work with the Guttman Lab which yielded <a href="http://gin.caltech.edu/">Gin</a></li>
  <li>The lack of any sort of organizational paradigm for the massive amounts of functional genomic data that can be mapped to structural information. This will be the challenge I intend to take on as a dedicated portion of my thesis project.</li>
</ul>

<p>My collaborator at the Guttman Lab, Noah Ollikainen, elaborates further on this second point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current websites for accessing functional genomic data allow users to view gene expression data (RNA-seq) as well as find the DNA binding sites for proteins that regulate gene expression (ChIP-seq). A major challenge with using these websites is navigating the sheer volume of data, as RNA-seq experiments have now been performed in hundreds of different cell types and ChIP-seq experiments been performed for hundreds of different proteins. To access these data, a user must know exactly what they are looking for, e.g., the DNA binding sites of protein A in the genome of human cell-type B, and this severely limits our ability to <strong>perform exploratory research that enables novel discoveries</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>An improved interface would organize these data in a biologically meaningful way. For example, these data could be organized hierarchically, where experiments in cell types derived from the same organ (e.g., liver, brain, kidney) are grouped together and experiments on proteins with a shared function (gene activator, gene repressor) are grouped together. Additionally, filters could be implemented to allow the user to restrict the data to a subset of interest, for example, cell lines derived from females only or data collected within the past N years. This organizational scheme would allow the user to easily select the most relevant functional genomic data for their research and explore the general relationship between these data and 3D genome structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Noah’s emphasis on exploratory research harkens back to the criteria of success I tackled in a previous blog post. One of the goals of genomic data visualization is to allow the exploration of complex data spaces in meaningful ways. In many cases, researchers don’t know what they are looking for, and look to visualization as a means for developing heuristics for narrowing down and identifying signficant features in these complex data spaces. The ideal workflow would combine methods of visualizing structure and methods of identifying functional data of interest to create a holistic understanding. I’ve made the following diagram to sketch out our goals here:</p>
